            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p id="para1">
                Born in Pauri, Uttarakhand on March 16, 1958, his family had been serving in the Indian Army for
                multiple generations. His father Laxman Singh Rawat was from Sainj village of the Pauri Garhwal district
                and rose to the rank of Lt General.
                An alumnus of the National Defence Academy (NDA) and the Indian Military Academy (IMA), Rawat was
                commissioned into the Indian Army in December 1978 in the same unit as his father, the fifth battalion
                of 11 Gorkha Rifles. The first CDS is a veteran of counterinsurgency warfare and has served in some of
                the most difficult terrains of India, including the northern and eastern commands.

            <h3>Military Career</h3>
            <p id="para2">
                On December 16, 1978, CDS Bipin Rawat was posted to that same unit of the 5th battalion of the 11 Gorkha
                Rifles as his father, Laxman Singh Rawat. CDS Bipin Rawat, then a Major, commanded a company in the
                battle of Uri in Jammu & Kashmir. He was appointed as Brigadier and led a multinational Brigade in a
                Chapter VII mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the 5 Sector of the Rashtriya Rifles at
                Sopore. When Bipin Rawat was promoted to Major General, he took control of the 19th Infantry Division in
                Uri as the General Officer Commanding. He led the III Corps, located in Dimapur, as a Lieutenant General
                before obtaining command of the Southern Army in Pune.
                After being appointed Army Commander, he became Southern Command General Officer Commanding-in-Chief
                (GOC-in-C). After such a short time, he was elevated to Vice Chief of Army Staff. On December 17, 2016,
                the Government of India named him the 27th Chief of Army Staff, and he took office on December 31, 2016.
                He was also the 57th and last Chairman of the Indian Army's Chiefs of Staff Committee. He was appointed
                the first CDS on December 30, 2019, and took office on January 1, 2020.

            <h3>Strike in Myanmar:-</h3>
            He was vital in diminishing militancy within the Northeast. One of his career milestones was the Indian
            Army's successful response to an NSCN-K terrorist strike in Myanmar in 2015. Rawat led the expedition
            from the operating command of the Dimapur-based III Corps. Based on precise intelligence inputs, the 
            Indian Air Force and 21 PARA (SF) carried a cross-border operation along the India–Myanmar border and 
            destroyed two Militant camps one each of NSCN (K) and KYKL, along the India–Myanmar border.  <br>

            <h3>Surgical Strike:-</h3>
            He also helped design the 2016 surgical strikes, during which the Indian Army crossed the Line of
            Control towards Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. He is the core commander, General Rawat was the architect of
            the first surgical strikes undertaken by India in a foreign country. Operation Sunrise resulted in
            bringing down insurgency levels in the north-east India. <br>

            <h3>The United Nations Mission:-</h3>
            When Bipin Rawat assumed command of the United Nations' North Kivu Brigade in the Democratic Republic of
            the Congo in 2008, the world's most expensive peacekeeping operation, known by its French title MONUC,
            was not doing well. Angry crowds would often throw stones at UN vehicles on the streets of Goma, the
            city of North Kivu. General Rawat was a brigadier when he was posted to the Congo in August 2008 to head
            the Indian Army's biggest deployment on foreign territory. He got right to work and immediately saw why
            the peacekeepers were trying to keep the situation in the Congo, then known as Zaire, under control.
            Under his direction, the Indian peacekeepers shifted from a soft glove to an iron fist.
